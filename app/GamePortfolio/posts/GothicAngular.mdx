This game was created with the help of two other people :) It was fun to create something as a team and see it all come together. I worked on the hooking mechanics of the game, some UI stuff, the sound, and the inspectors of the fish.

## Some extra things I did

I personally worked on polishing and working out some of the core mechanics of the game over winter break. I added the score on the end screen, polished the hooking mechanic, added more sounds, and put in the pop up instruction text at the start of the game.

In the future, we would like to incorporate more sound effects, and a luck of chance if the fish hooks onto your line instead of just always catching on collision. Also adding an instructions button on the starting menu.
