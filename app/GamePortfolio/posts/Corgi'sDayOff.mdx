The team behind the summer Game Development workshop at Chapman had the idea of making a platformer game as an introduction into game developement and level design for high school/middle school students. Miles Duncan had already made this game in his free time and I was able to polish it up and add all of the UI as well as create the art work for the UI. I used photoshop for the first time to create all of the UI art.

## Check Out The Game!

Currently, the game is unable to support a build due to the fact that we implemented a saving system for the levels that the kids create so that they don't lose their progress. We are currently working on optimizing it so that we can publish a executable file of the game.
