After having learned a lot of backend programming languages, I really wanted to try and turn that into a game or something that could be in a game. I had heard people say that they use
Java and C++ in the industry but I could never image how. So I started this project after getting a refresher in Java because when you are fresh out of learning something, it is all
you want to code in lol. This project is very simple but has the challage of inheritance and organization. Something that student programmers struggle with. 
Which goes where and not trying to duplicate code. I orginally wanted to make this for my final extra credit project but unfortunately had no time during finals week.

I have an outline of what I want to do in my journal. Since this is an early version of what I have, it will look super sloppy. 
If you are a hiring manager, please note that my code normally looks a lot nicer and more comprehensible :)

## GitHub of my progress so far:

## Additional add ons I would like to do
Future: I will be fleshing out the Ability class and adding the following classes: Body, Hair, Accessories, Clothes, Shoes, and Weaponry

There isn't a particular order in which I will add these, but I would like to also add an IO file into this so that the player's 
character gets saved throughout the entire program.
