After having learned a lot of backend programming languages, I really wanted to try and turn that into a game or something that could be in a game. I had heard people say that they use
Java and C++ in the industry but I could never image how. So I started this project after getting a refresher in Java because when you are fresh out of learning something, it is all
you want to code in lol. This project is very simple but has the challage of inheritance and organization. Something that student programmers struggle with. 
Which goes where and not trying to duplicate code. I orginally wanted to make this for my final extra credit project but unfortunately had no time during finals week.
