After getting through to the final round of interviewing for an amazing internship, I learned that I would be learning
iOS development. I took it upon myself to go through an online lecture course on youtube to prepare myself. I am in the process
of creating some app projects to soon put on my coding portfolio!

I have been enjoying the language and have been learning just to know more about iOS
development and using Xcode. I really want to make an app about my cat.

## Curious what i've learned and from who?
