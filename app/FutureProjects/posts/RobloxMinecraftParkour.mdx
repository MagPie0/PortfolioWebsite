I saw a job listing for a Roblox server creator. It was a contracted job on LinkedIn and I found it super interesting.
 Around that time, I had also seen a mother showing her son going to a Roblox camp and learning how to make their own obby. 
 I thought that was so incredibly cool. I knew that Roblox had its own engine, but I had never thought of looking into it. So granted,
  these two things made me curious about what I could do. The engine has been really straightforward and honestly has been super fun to 
  see all the different tools and assets they offer. Since I am a beginner in this realm, I decided to make a Minecraft parkour map. It is 
  basically an obby but skinned and based on my imagination of when I used to make parkour maps in Minecraft as a kid.

## Will you publish it?
I hope so! I have been in a bit of a creative mood this summer (2024) and have honestly been bouncing around 5 different projects. 
I honestly have no idea if I will ever finish this, but I should make a design doc so I have an idea of an ending for the first level. 
I would love to learn Lua through this project, as it is a programming language that I have been wanting to learn more about in game making.
