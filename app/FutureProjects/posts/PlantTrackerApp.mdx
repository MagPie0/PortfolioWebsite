During this summer (2024), I really wanted to further my knowledge in Xcode and Swift after getting 
through to the final round of interviewing for an amazing iOS internship. I took it upon myself to go
through an online lecture course on youtube to prepare myself.

## Curious the basics i've learned and from who?

## Plant Tracking
I've brain stormed a bunch of different apps to make but I think this one would show off a lot of different skills. From 
storyboarding, data input, and tracking. Also, this app would benefit me a lot with keeping track of my garden. I love my plants!

This app will allow me to enter in each of the different plants in my garden and in my room, and allow me to keep track of when
I have watered them! I would also like to add a notification when I haven't watered in a week.
