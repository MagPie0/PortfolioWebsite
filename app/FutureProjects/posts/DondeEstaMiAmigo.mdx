3D Unity project derived from my roll-a-ball level design project. You are a tennis ball that got thrown too far from your owner, 
and now you need to make your way back home without getting too worn down. There are 4 levels with core game mechanics such as jumping, attacking, and enemies.

My design document is found here: [Donde mi amigo - Game Design Doc.docx](https://chapman0-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/hillebrecht_chapman_edu/EekVNQMHUvZBud7t5KLoo_gBLZ2zAPk5ghSHUZOpUfsk4Q?rtime=ALPR7d6o3Eg)

## What made you want to make this game?
I felt like my roll-a-ball project lacked a lot of creativity, and I simply didn't have enough time to give the project my full attention. 
I had never worked on a 3D game before, so there were a lot of creative limitations for me. I originally had my roll-a-ball be my cat picking up treats,
but the levels themselves didn't have much going on. So, this project is for me to really dive into my creativity when it comes to artwork, as well as test
my new level design skills and further build my C# skills. So far, I have had a lot of fun just being able to try new tools and mess around with design. 
I had never really considered myself a creative person when it comes to art and design, but with this project, it has been super fun to decide how each 
level will look. Granted, I keep getting ideas in my dreams that I want to implement, so the level document above is not currently up to date with my head.

## Difficulties I am currently experiencing
My biggest setback at the moment is the attack move. I want there to be an animation with it because, with the current movement speed and 
parkour style of the levels, I want the attacks to be fluid and a little bit fast-paced. My current vision is that when you press space and then E, 
the tennis ball will move at a 45-degree angle into the enemy and then go back to its original position. Kind of like a boomerang effect when the player presses E.
This has got me learning animation within Unity, which has seemed straightforward, but having your whole player be the animation instead of a sword swinging has been 
a huge challenge in figuring out. I spoke with a couple of people who have more experience in animation in Unity. I am currently trying to change the position 
of the player when they are in the air and press E, but the motion is not fluid whatsoever and is more of a teleportation than an attack.
