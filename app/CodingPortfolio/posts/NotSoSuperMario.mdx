Created an automatic game of Mario! Requires a file with 8 lines with percentages 
and numbers for things like, the number of lives Mario will have, how big the levels will be,
and the chances of objects being placed in the world. 

This was a project I had always heard from other students because it is the most challenging due to the fact that you don't
have much to go off of from what you've learned in class. I agree that this was difficult until the due date but I enjoyed this 
assignement the most. Because we were making a game from scratch, it was a nice challenge to be able to create the puzzle pieces and
put them together and where they belonged. I will never forget the satisfaction when I got it all working.
