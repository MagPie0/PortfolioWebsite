I got inspired by two of my friends to code my own website. I used Vercel to get a template per their recommendation and had such a blast being able to learn typescript,
css, mdx, and js. I had only ever created local hosted projects using html, so this was a really big jump for me. I also truly learned Git and Github.

## You used a template, but what did you actually contribute?

Well, the orginal template can be found [here] (https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit)

I added two new tabs to showcase my work in various other ways. That caused additional routes, components, and utilites. I also added images
underneath my work so that there is more of an eye catching reason for you to see more about my work. No offense but the base template was a little too
boring for my liking. I also added small things like my socials, email, and the background (yes it is Stardew Valley (you can't totally see it on mobile, lo siento)).


## Future developement

I honestly want to treat this as if it was my tumblr. I wasn't exposed to the creative bounds that tumblr offered when I used it in middle school, so I enjoyed pretending that
this was my adult version of that. Except without the fan fictions and video edits of my favorites...

I want to add a custom mouse, maybe make the font a little more inviting, and add some fun extras like videos or gifs to
show off some of my games without you having to play it to see for yourself. I am always thinking the best for the hiring manager <3
