My second iOS app! A simple way to help me workout. The cards shuffle through and once you tap on the stop button, you do 
the work out that corresponds with the shape and do the number of reps represented through the card. There is a rules sheet that you can 
check throughout the app and simply slide down to go back to the main screen. The restart button will start the shuffle once more.

## Storyboard vs Programmatic
The online course I was taking while creating this app, showed how to make this app through storyboarding and Programmatic. I followed suit because
it made me see how, as a beginner, I really like to storyboard my apps before getting into the meat and potatoes of the code. However, I also learned 
that programmatic is something I will most likely use in my field of work as there is a lot more customization you can do and you truly have a lot of
creative freedom to customize your app to not just be within the bounds of iOS
