3D Unity project derived from my roll-a-ball level design project. You are a tennis ball that got thrown too far from your owner and now you need
to make your way back home without getting too worn down. There are 4 levels with core game mechanics such as jumping, attack, and enemies. 

My design document is found here: [Donde mi amigo - Game Design Doc.docx](https://chapman0-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/hillebrecht_chapman_edu/EekVNQMHUvZBud7t5KLoo_gBLZ2zAPk5ghSHUZOpUfsk4Q?rtime=ALPR7d6o3Eg)

## What made you want to make this game?
I felt like my roll-a-ball project lacked a lot of creativity and I simply didn't have enough time to give the project my full time. I had never worked on a 
3D game before, so there was a lot of creative limitations for me. I originally had my roll a ball be my cat picking up treats but the levels themselves didn't have much going on.
So, this project is for me to really dive into my creativity when it comes to art work as well as test my new level design skills and futher build my C# skills. So far I have had a lot of
fun just being able to try new tools and mess around with design. I had never really considered myself a creative when it comes to art and design, but with this project, it has been
super fun to decide how each level will look. Granted, I keep getting ideas in my dreams that I want to do, so the level document above is not currently up to date with my head.

## Difficulties I am currently experiencing
My biggest set back at the moment is the attack move. I want there to be an animation with it because with the current movement speed and parkour style of the levels, I want 
the attacks to be fluid and a little bit fast past. My current envision is that when you press space and then E, the tennis ball with move at a 45ish degree angle into the enemy
and then go back to its orginal position. Kind of like a boomarang effect when the player presses E. This has got me learning animation within Unity which has seemed straightforward,
but having your whole player be the animation instead of a sword swinging has been a huge challenge in figuring out. I spoke with a couple people who have more experience in animation
in unity. I am currently trying to change the position of the player when they are in the air and press E, but the motion is not fluid what to ever and is more of a teleporation than a attack.
