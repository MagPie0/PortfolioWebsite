summary: 'Explore the enduring debate between using spaces and tabs for code indentation, and why this choice matters more than you might think.'

Worked with a group of students to build an arcade machine for Chapman Fowler School of Engineering. I was apart of the microcontroller team to make sure the software, games, LEDS, marquees, and speakers worked. I also ended up doing a little bit of everything outside of my team as well! I did the art for the stream deck, helped decal the art work to the panels, helped with assembly, and even place the tempered glass in.


## Besides this being a class, why did I join this project?

Before this became an official and funded class by Fowler, the professor "teaching" this class had asked me over break if I would be interested in joining as a side project. I love being apart of projects, especially hands on where I can build anything (even if it isn't coding). I have always been the type of person where if I have a friend or a group of people who are passionate about a personal project, I try to help out as much as I can. That excitement and passion always radiates and makes me excited and passionate.

## The Case for Tabs

On the other side of the debate, proponents of tabs highlight the flexibility that tabs offer. Because the width of a tab can be adjusted in most text editors, individual developers can choose how much indentation they prefer to see, making the code more accessible and comfortable to read on a personal level. This adaptability can be particularly beneficial in teams with diverse preferences regarding code layout.

Tabs also have the advantage of semantic meaning. A tab is explicitly meant to represent indentation, whereas a space is used for many purposes within code. This distinction can make automated parsing and manipulation of code simpler, as tools can more easily recognize and adjust indentation levels without confusing them with spaces used for alignment.

## Hybrid Approaches and Team Dynamics

The debate often extends into discussions about hybrid approaches, where teams might use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment within lines, attempting to combine the best of both worlds. However, such strategies require clear team agreements and disciplined adherence to coding standards to prevent formatting chaos.

Ultimately, the choice between spaces and tabs often comes down to team consensus and project guidelines. In environments where collaboration and code sharing are common, agreeing on a standard that everyone follows is more important than the individual preferences of spaces versus tabs. Modern development tools and linters can help enforce these standards, making the choice less about technical limitations and more about team dynamics and coding philosophy.

## Conclusion

While the spaces vs. tabs debate might not have a one-size-fits-all answer, it underscores the importance of consistency, readability, and team collaboration in software development. Whether a team chooses spaces, tabs, or a hybrid approach, the key is to make a conscious choice that serves the project's needs and to adhere to it throughout the codebase. As with many aspects of coding, communication and agreement among team members are paramount to navigating this classic programming debate.
